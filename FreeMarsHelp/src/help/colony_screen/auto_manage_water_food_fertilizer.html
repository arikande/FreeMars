        <h1>Auto manage water, food and fertilizer resources</h1>
        This panel allows user to automanage colony's water, food and 
        fertilizer resources. Auto managing water and food resources will
        assign required amount of colonists to water and food producing tiles
        or improvements from the "production workforce". If there is not
        enough colonists in "production workforce", it will not take any
        colonists from tiles extracting other resources like silica, or other
        resource manufacturing colony improvements like steel factory. It is
        advisable to keep a small percent of colonists in the producion
        workforce as a buffer.
        <br><br>
        When auto managing fertilizer is on, the colony will distribute its
        fertilizer resource to food producing tiles using 25 fertilizer per
        tile.
