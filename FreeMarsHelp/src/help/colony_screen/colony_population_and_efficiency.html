        <h1>Colony population and efficiency</h1>
        Colony's current population and efficiency is displayed here. The
        population of a colony will increase if it has enough food and water
        in its current stock; this is true even if it is not producing enough
        of these resources and its food or water stock is diminishing.
        <br><br>
        Following quantities of food and water is needed per colonist:
        <br><br>
        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <td>Resource</td><td>Quantity needed per colonist</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Food</td><td>6</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Water</td><td>1</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        A colony's efficiency can drop with increasing population. Building
        improvements like a theater or an arena can increase the efficiency.
