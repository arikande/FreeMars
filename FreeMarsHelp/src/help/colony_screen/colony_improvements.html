        <h1>Colony improvements</h1>
        Improvements that are built in the colony are displayed in this panel,
        with total upkeep cost displayed in the footer. If an improvement
        produces a resource and colonists must be assigned to it, the quantity
        and number of colonists is displayed near the improvement image.

        If a colony improvement is assigned its maximum number of colonists then
        the information is displayed in green. The improvement will produce its
        maximum output if it needs and has enough input resources.
