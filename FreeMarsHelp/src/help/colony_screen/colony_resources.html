        <h1>Colony resources</h1>
        Colony resource production quantities and current storage amounts are
        displayed in this panel. Resources that are being harvested or produced
        are displayed with a "+" where resources that are being used are
        displayed with a "-". If an essential resource like water or food is
        being spent more than it is being produced, the production is displayed
        in red.
