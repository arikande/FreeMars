        <h1>Shuttle</h1>
        The SC-1907 shuttle is the pack mule of Martian colonization, it is used
        to transport all kinds of materials between Mars and Earth. These goods
        form the backbone of an early Martian economy, as credits from
        exported iron and silica are the only notable source of income in
        first years of colonization.<br><br>
        This spaceship will need 5 turns to travel between Mars and Earth, and
        its cargo bays can carry 3000 tons of following goods:
        <ul>
            <li>Food</li>
            <li>Stone</li>
            <li>Iron</li>
            <li>Lumber</li>
            <li>Silica</li>
        </ul>
