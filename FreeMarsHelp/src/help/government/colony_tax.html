    <h2>Colony tax</h2>
    Taxes can be collected from Mars colonists as an income for the
    colonial governments. At the end of each month, a colonist in the free
    workforce pool of an individual colony will generate 3 credits multiplied
    by the current colonial tax rate. 
    <br><br>
    For example, if there are 10 colonists in the free workforce pool of a
    colony and the current tax rate is %50, then an income of 15 credits will
    come from colonial tax. Likewise 20 colonists will produce 60 credits each
    month if the colonial tax rate is %100.
    <br><br>
    Imposing this tax on Martian colonists will have a negative impact on their
    production since it will decrease with the ratio of the applied tax.
    Normally, 10 colonists in the free workforce pool will produce 10 production
    points each month if the colonial tax is %0; this will decrease to 5
    production points if a tax of %50 is applied. Imposing colonial tax will
    cause colonies to have longer completion times for building improvements or
    units.
    <br><br>
    Colonial tax is a weaker income alternative when compared with income from
    exporting goods; it is not recommended unless there is an emergency need for
    credits or exporting goods is not possible due to Martian war of
    independence. Normally, a colonist mining silica, or producing steel will
    provide a higher income for Mars. Some colony improvements like trading post
    or market increase tax income from a colony.
    <h2>Manage colony tax dialog</h2>
    "Manage colony tax" dialog can be used to set colony tax rate; this dialog
    displays "Tax rate", "Income" (from colony tax only), "Expenses" and
    resulting "Net income". The dialog can be opened by using the shortcut
    Ctrl+T or Tax menu item under Government menu.
