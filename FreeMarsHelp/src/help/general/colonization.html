    <h1>Colonization</h1>
    Mars was opened to settlers for the countries which have participated in
    terraforming project of planet. In United Nations it was agreed that each
    participant country to send 2
    <a href="../unit/colonizer.html">colonizers</a> with 100 settlers each, 
    2 <a href="../unit/engineer.html">engineers</a> and 1
    <a href="../unit/scout.html">scout</a> for initial settlement.<br><br>
    By 2065 Earth's resources were diminishing in an alarming rate. Few
    forests remained, mega mining operations poisoned the soil  irreversibly.
    It became clear to countries that ecosystem of Earth would collapse if
    we did not change our ways. To solve these problems, a United Nations
    Resolution was passed that limited harvesting of Earth's resources,
    which was not much welcome among general population.
    <br><br>
    Although terraforming had just started, countries could not hold their
    desire for fresh resources of this new world. This desire, coupled with
    slenderness of available resources on Earth, started the colonization
    of Red planet.
