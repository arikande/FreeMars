    <h1>Terraforming</h1>
    Terraforming of the Red planet began in 2069 and has three major stages.
    The ultimate aim is to make Mars completely habitable for mankind
    without the need of protective suits and with enough food for a
    reasonable population.<br><br>
    <h2>Melting of polar ice</h2>
    Mars has a lot or water and Carbondioxide ice in its polar caps.
    Permanent portion of the north polar cap consists almost entirely of
    water ice whereas south polar cap has both dry and water ice. By sending
    hundreds of unmanned "heater" probes to these regions melting of ice has
    begun. Probes use nuclear power so their lifespan is enough to release huge
    amounts of water vapor and Carbondioxide gas to Martian atmosphere.
    <h2>Thicker and stronger atmosphere</h2>
    Heating of polar ice also serves for this objective. Melting of dry ice
    releases large volumes of carbondioxide to the atmosphere which already has
    abundant C0<sub>2</sub>. After years of work, this is making thin
    Martian atmosphere a little more stronger and thicker. With more humidity
    the planet will be able to keep more heat than radiating it back to space.
    <h2>Increase oxygen gas amount</h2>
    Genetically altered algae are given the task of converting abundant
    C0<sub>2</sub> to 0<sub>2</sub> under harsh and cold conditions of the Red
    planet. With no competition for their habitat this primitive form of life
    now covers almost all of Martian swamps. Algae are also provide food for
    the few types of fish sent to Mars.
    <h2>Terrain transformation</h2>
    Engineers can be used to transform Martian terrain to increase food
    production. After transformation the terrain is leveled, hills and
    mountains are changed to flat lands for agricultural soil, removing any
    iron and mineral deposits.

    Transformation will remove all bonus resources and improvements
    on a tile.
