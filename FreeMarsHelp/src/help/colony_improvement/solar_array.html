        <h1>Solar array</h1>
        All colony improvements that are used to produce goods need energy to 
        run. Cheapest way to supply this energy is to build a solar array.
        <br><br>
        This improvement produces 100 units of energy each turn, which will be
        enough to power early manufacturing buildings.
