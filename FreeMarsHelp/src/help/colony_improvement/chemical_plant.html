        <h1>Chemical plant</h1>
        Chemical plants will use minerals and energy to produce valuable
        chemicals which will get a good sale price on Earth. Building this
        colony improvement in regions where minerals are abundant will have a
        positive effect in trading income.
        <br><br>
        This colony improvement is very expensive to build and has a high
        maintenance cost. It is advisable to build chemical plants only in
        central locations and bring minerals (and energy if needed) from
        surrounding smaller colonies.
