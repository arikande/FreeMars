        <h1>Granary</h1>
        The granary, being one of the first settlement improvements in human
        civilization, is also one of the first facilities that are built on
        a Martian colony.<br><br>
        By keeping grain in necessary heat and moisture conditions this colony
        improvement allows more food to be stored, thus increasing the
        efficiency of the consumption.
