        Starports allow spacecraft traveling between Earth and Mars to land on
        a colony. This improvement is essential for loading and unloading
        resources thus maintaining a stable trade between Martian colonies and
        Earth governments.<br><br>
        First starport built on Mars is financed by player's Earth government.
        Also, a year's maintainance cost for the starport is added to colonial
        treasury.
