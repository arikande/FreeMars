        <h1>Food silo</h1>
        Food silos increase the quantity of grain that is stored in a colony.
        Like a granary this building complex will help food to be consumed
        more efficiently by storing grain in ideal conditions.
        <br><br>
        Since grain production is difficult on Martian surfrace, larger
        colonies will need a food silo to sustain their increasing population.
