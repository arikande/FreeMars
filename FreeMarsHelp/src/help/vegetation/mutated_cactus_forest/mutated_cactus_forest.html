        <h1>Mutated cactus forest</h1>
        Trees in a mutated cactus forest are not in fact cacti, the name
        comes from their somewhat resemblance to Saguaro Cacti of Arizona. Genetic
        engineers grew this species by splicing cactus DNA with some other
        plants.<br><br>
        In the initial stages terraforming Mars has a cold environment but it
        is also very dry. Plants growing on the arid surface of planet
        can conserve water thanks to their cacti DNA.<br><br>
