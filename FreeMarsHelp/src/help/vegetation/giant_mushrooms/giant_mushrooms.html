        Usually having a height between 1 and 2 meters, giant mushrooms are
        another type of "organism" able to withstand the harsh conditions of
        Mars.
        <br><br>
        Like all fungi, giant mushrooms of the Red planet are not plants
        and do not have the ability of photosynthesis. Instead they undergo
        chemosynthesis using hydrogen sulfide in Martian soil to support
        their growth.
