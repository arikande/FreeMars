        <h1>Martian scrub forest</h1>
         A scrub forest is mainly composed of plants that are less than
         8 metres (26 ft) high and usually have many stems arising at or
         near the base.
         <br><br>
         All of these plants are genetically engineered to resist Martian 
         drought by such mechanisms as waxy, waterproof coatings on their
         leaves.
