        Mars has many useful minerals like sulfates or chlorides, but sending
        these raw resources to Earth will yield little income. Credits coming
        from minerals can support an early economy but as the population and
        number of improvements to support it increases, new income sources are
        needed.<br><br>
        Produced at the chemical plants using minerals and energy, chemicals
        will give more income to colonies than minerals. As the production
        and maintainance costs are high for chemical plants, it is feasible to
        build these improvements only in larger colonies.
