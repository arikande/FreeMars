        <h1>Silica</h1>
        Silica is abundant on Mars and easily extracted. It is one of the most
        important incomes of an early Martian economy.<br><br>
        Silica deposits are found in hills and mountains of Mars. Building mines
        in these terrain will increase silica output.
