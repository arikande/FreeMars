        <h1>Lumber</h1>
        The idea of transporting lumber from Mars and selling it on Earth
        would put a smile on someone's face 50 years ago, but with the
        introduction of "very" strict forestry regulations on Earth, even
        low quality Mars wood can sometimes find customers. Selling lumber to
        Earth will bring little income to Martian settlers.<br><br>
        Some genetically engineered plants like Mutated cactii or
        Giant mushrooms can be used to produce lumber.
