        <h1>Hydrogen</h1>
        Hydrogen is mainly used as rocket fuel for spaceships that transfer
        resources and goods between Martian colonies and Earth. Each spacehip
        launched from a colony will need a defined amount of hydrogen fuel
        to reach Mars orbit, thus making hydrogen resource an essential part
        of trade between the Red planet and Earth.
