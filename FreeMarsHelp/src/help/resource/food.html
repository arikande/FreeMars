        Finding food to feed themselves has always been the toughest challenge
        for colonizers in human history and Mars is no exception. Even with
        terraforming (that is far from complete) barren wasteland of Red
        planet offers little opportunity for agriculture, especially in first
        years of colonization.<br><br>
        Martian settlers will have a hard time growing crops on Mars. Even
        genetically engineered plants suffer from harsh conditions of the
        planet.<br><br>
        The only terrain that is able to produce enough food to feed workers
        on it is plains, wastelands can also make a little addition to
        agriculture if supported with irrigation built on them.
