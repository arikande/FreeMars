        <h1>Energy</h1>
        Energy is used in Martian colony improvements that produce other
        resources or goods. With the help of technological advances in last
        decades it became almost possible to store energy like any other
        resource. In this way excess energy produced in colony facilities like
        solar arrays can be stored for later use.
