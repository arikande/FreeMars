        <h1>Terrain improvements</h1>
        Inhospitable terrain of Mars would be of little use to colonizers
        if it was not improved with roads, irrigation or mines.
        <br><br>
        Of these improvements, irrigation is most crucial for the survival of
        Martian population since producing enough food would be impossible
        without it.
        <br><br>
        Roads would allow rapid transportation of goods and resources between
        cities.
        <br><br>
        Mines would increase iron and mineral output of cities thus increasing
        income for an early economy.
