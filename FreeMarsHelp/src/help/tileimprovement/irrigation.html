        <h1>Irrigation</h1>
        Once the terraforming began, underground water of Mars
        increased dramatically, fed by melting of abundant water ice in
        polar caps. Because of this irrigation can be built on many types of
        terrain.
        <br><br>
        Irrigation are invaluable for survival on Red planet since they are
        the only choice to feed growing colonizer population.
        <br><br>
        Vegetation on a tile needs to be cleared before building irrigation.
        Also irrigation can not be built on a tile that alredy has a mine.
