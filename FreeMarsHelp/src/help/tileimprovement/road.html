        <h1>Roads</h1>
        Roads are essential for rapid transportation of extracted resources and
        produced goods between colonies. Since the income from tax is very
        little, exports to Earth are the fuel of Martian economy.<br><br>
        The shuttles carrying these exports can land on and take off from
        colonies having a starport, which is an expensive facility to build in
        every colony. This requires goods to be transported by land from the
        colonies not having this improvement.<br><br>
        A good network of roads speeds up this transportation process
        considerably, allowing a stronger economy.<br><br>
        Roads also cause a slight increase in tax income.<br><br>
