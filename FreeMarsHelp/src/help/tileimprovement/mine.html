        <h1>Mines</h1>
        Building a mines would increase iron, silica and mineral output of a
        colony, resulting in more income from the export of these resources.
        Hills, mountains and craters are ideal locations for building mines
        since they have more valuable reserves. Mines can also be built on
        deserts.

        Vegetation on a tile needs to be cleared before building a mine. Also
        mines can not be built on a tile that alredy has irrigation.
