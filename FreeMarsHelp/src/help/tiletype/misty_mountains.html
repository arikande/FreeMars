        <h1>Misty mountains</h1>
        Named after J.R.R Tolkien's Middle Earth mountain chain, these type
        of mountains differ from normal Martian mountains because of
        the extreme water vapor that covers them, which also makes traveling
        these heights extremely difficult.<br><br>
        Iron and stone resources on them may provide useful if mined, not
        surprisingly they yield no food for Martian settlers.<br><br>
