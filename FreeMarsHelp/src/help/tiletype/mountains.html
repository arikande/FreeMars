        <h1>Mountains</h1>
        While mountains are rare on Mars, the planet is also the site of 
        Olympus Mons, the highest known mountain within the Solar System<br><br>
        Movement in this type of terrain is difficult, but mountains
        have good iron, magnesium and aluminium production, it will not
        produce any food though. In battle, it will provide significant
        advantages to defender, doubling its strength.<br><br>
