        <h1>Ice</h1>
        Martian polar caps are covered with water ice and are useless for
        settlement. They are being melted in the slow process of terraforming
        Mars. Swamps that have emerged in past decades get their water
        from these ice covered regions.
        <br><br>
        This type of terrain has no resource production. In
        battle, it will not provide any advantages to defender.<br><br>
