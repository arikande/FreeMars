        <h1>Chasm</h1>
        Chasms or very steep ravines are found near Valles Marineris, a huge
        canyon that is more than 4,000 km long, 200 km wide and up to 7 km deep.
        <br><br>
        Steep heights of this rift system makes traveling very difficult, if
        not impossible. Because of this difficulty, agriculture or mining is not
        done in this type of terrain. In battle, it will provide significant
        advantages to defender.<br><br>
