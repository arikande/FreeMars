        <h1>Hills</h1>
        Hills are more common on the southern hemisphere of Mars, whereas the
        northern hemisphere is generally flat. There is very little tectonic
        activity on planet, because of this Martian hills are old and generally
        smooth.
        <br><br>
        While causing some problems for transportation, this type of terrain
        has good iron, silica and mineral production, but it will
        produce very little food if used for agriculture. In
        battle, it will provide significant advantages to defender.<br><br>
