        <h1>Desert</h1>
        Martian deserts are not hot like Earth deserts, but they
        resemble in amount of precipitation they receive. Rain is very rare
        in poorly terraformed Mars and it is almost non existent in desert
        terrain of the Red planet.
        <br><br>
        This type of terrain has some silica deposits and very little food can
        be produced. In battle, it will not provide any advantages to
        defender.<br><br>
