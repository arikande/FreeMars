        Plains are the only type of terrain on Mars that are suitable for
        agriculture. Giving barely enough food to feed the population
        working on it, plains are preferred regions to build new colonies.
        <br><br>
        This type of terrain has no silica or iron deposits. In battle, it
        will not provide any advantages to defender.<br><br>
