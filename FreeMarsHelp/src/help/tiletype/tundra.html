        <h1>Tundra</h1>
        The "tundra" on Mars refers only to the areas where the subsoil is
        permafrost, or permanently frozen. This, added to the already
        inhospitable environment of Red planet, makes these terrain nearly
        useless for human colonization. Tundra terrain can be found near polar
        regions of the planet.
        <br><br>
        This type of terrain has no silica or iron deposits, it will produce
        very little food, some stone can be mined from it though. In battle, it
        will not provide any advantages to defender.<br><br>
