        <h1>Crater</h1>
        If compared, Martian atmosphere is only a fraction of Earth's atmosphere
        making it unable to stop meteors from hitting the planet surface, as a
        result there are hundreds of thousands of craters on Mars larger
        than 1 km.<br><br>
        Sometimes these craters provide good opportunities
        for mining operations as they expose lower layers making them easier
        to drill. These mines will produce moderate amounts of elements
        like magnesium, silica or minerals. Cratered terrain is not suitable
        for agriculture.
