    <h1>Mars</h1>
    Named after the Roman god of war, Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in
    the Solar System. It is often described as the "Red Planet", as the iron
    oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance.
    <br><br>
    Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere,
    having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the
    Moon and the volcanoes, valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.
    The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar
    to those of Earth, as is the tilt that produces the seasons.
    <br><br>
    Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the highest known mountain within the
    Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, the largest canyon. The smooth
    Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and
    may be a giant impact feature.<br><br>
    Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly
    shaped, these may be captured asteroids.
